I am a Ph.D. student at [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, advised by Associate Professor [Weichi Wu](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1023/1048.htm). I completed my undergraduate studies at [School of Statistics and Data Science](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn), Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, advised by Professor [Xingdong Feng](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/9c/d5/c714a236757/page.htm). I previously visited the [Department of Statistics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/), University of Warwick, advised by Professor [Chenlei Leng](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/leng/).

My research interests include change point detection, statistical network analysis, and causal inference. I‘m also exploring topics related to reinforcement learning.

# Miscs

I’m interested in [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) solving and its theory. I’ve participated in competitions, with my WCA ID [2016FANX01](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016FANX01?event=222). I mainly focus on [Fewest Moves](https://fmcsolves.cubing.net/fmc_tutorial_ENG.pdf), with some achievements including: Champion of Fewest Moves at *China Championship 2019*, Champion of *FMC Shanghai 2019*, 4th place in *FMC Asia 2018*.

Feel free to contact me for any academic or other inquiries.
